# WhisperNoLimits

This code uses whisper to transcribe audio to text https://github.com/openai/whisper.Whisper has a 25 MB limit, this doenst mean that ypu can't transcribe a file that its size is greater that 25 MG,you just have to divide the file until you have many that make less than 25 MB.With this trick you can transcribe audio to text,on any audio text,without worryng about the audio file size,with the quality of the whisper model
